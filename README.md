# About me

##### I am a Cyber Security Engineer based out of Dunedin, New Zealand.

##### Currently I am upskilling a number of things including - my knowledge of python, powershell, shell scripting, and SQL.

##### My goal is to store any scripts that I create here, on github. And anything useful, interesting or noteworthy I will make public.
