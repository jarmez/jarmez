### About me

# I am a Cyber Security Engineer based out of Dunedin, New Zealand.

# Currently I am upskilling a number of things including - my knowledge of python, powershell, shell scripting, and SQL.
# Just anything to increase my usable skills really. 

# My goal is to store any scripts that I create here, on github. And anything useful, interesting or noteworthy I will make public.

# Currently I am available to work - or at least have a conversation about it! And can be reached at james@day.net.nz
